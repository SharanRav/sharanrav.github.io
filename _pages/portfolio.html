### Project Overview
The **COAST Guidewire** is the `world's smallest` tendon-driven robotic guidewire designed for high-precision endovascular interventions.  This project integrates real-time shape sensing and force feedback with fiber bragg Grating sensors to improve localization and navigation in complex vascular networks.

### Robot Demonstration
Below is the demonstration presented at the **Hamlyn Symposium on Medical Robotics**.
