### Project Overview
The **COAST Guidewire** is the `world's smallest` tendon-driven robotic guidewire designed for high-precision endovascular interventions. This project integrates real-time shape sensing and force feedback with **Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)** sensors to improve localization and navigation in complex vascular networks.

### Key Features

* **Novel Design:** Small-scale steerable mechanism engineered specifically for **reducing axial perforation** during navigation.
* **Integrated Sensing:** Real-time force and shape feedback loops designed for both **surgeon haptics** and **autonomous control systems**.
* **Clinical Impact:** Target outcomes include reducing radiation exposure (fluoroscopy time), improving patient safety, and significantly lowering procedure duration in **neurosurgery**.
