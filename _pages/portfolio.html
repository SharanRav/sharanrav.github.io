  <h2>Shape and Force Sensing Robotic Guidewire</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>COAST Guidewire</strong> is the <code style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">world's smallest</code> tendon-driven robotic guidewire (0.36mm-0.89mm) designed for high-precision endovascular interventions. This project integrates real-time shape sensing and force feedback with <strong>Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)</strong> sensors to improve localization and navigation in complex vascular networks.

  <p>Below is the demonstration presented at the <strong>Hamlyn Symposium on Medical Robotics</strong>.</p>
