I am a Robotics Controls Lead and a Georgia Tech Ph.D. Robotics grad specializing in **Autonomous Surgical Intervention**, **Physical AI**, and **Real-time Control**. 

My research bridges the gap between high-level AI perception and low-level mechanical control, specifically for micro-scale medical robotics. Currently, I lead a multidisciplinary engineering team in industry, deploying **GPU-accelerated perception models** and **autonomous navigation systems** on Edge-AI hardware.

### Key Research Interests
* **Medical Robotics:** Design and control of steerable continuum robots and guidewires.
* **Embodied AI:** Real-time perception and autonomous decision-making for surgical tasks.
* **Control Theory:** Variable stiffness control and data-driven non-linear control.

### Recent News
* **[2025]** Joined Raphe mPhibr, a high-growth UAV startup as a Robotics Controls Engineer to advance autonomous navigation abilites
* **[2025]** Graduated from the Robotics PhD program at Georgia Tech
* **[2024]** Honored as a **Topping Fellow** at Georgia Tech (Top 5% of CoE PhDs by impact).
* **[2023]** Invited Talk at **Harvard Medical School** (NCIGT) on Surgical Intelligence.
