I am a Robotics Controls Lead and a Georgia Tech Ph.D. Robotics grad specializing in **Autonomous Surgical Intervention**, **Physical AI**, and **Real-time Control**. 

My research bridges the gap between high-level AI perception and low-level mechanical control, specifically for **micro-scale medical robotics**. Currently, I lead a multidisciplinary engineering team in industry, deploying **GPU-accelerated perception models** and **autonomous navigation systems** on Edge-AI hardware for **UAVs**. I'm passionate about translating surgical robotics from lab to clinical practice

I received my PhD in Robotics from Georgia Tech advised by Jaydev P. Desai, and my Masters' in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from the same university.

### Key Research Interests
* **Medical Robotics:** Design and control of steerable continuum robots and guidewires.
* **Embodied AI:** Real-time perception and autonomous decision-making for surgical tasks.
* **Control Theory:** Variable stiffness control and data-driven non-linear control.

### Recent News
* **[2025]** Joined Raphe mPhibr, a high-growth UAV startup as a Robotics Controls Engineer to advance autonomous navigation abilities.
* **[2025]** Best Paper Award in ICRA 2025 Workshop on Medical Robotics.
* **[2025]** Graduated from the Robotics PhD program at Georgia Tech.
* **[2024]** Honored as a **Topping Fellow** at Georgia Tech (Top 5% of CoE PhDs by impact).
* **[2023]** Invited Talk at **Harvard Medical School** (NCIGT) on Surgical Intelligence.
