Work experience
======
* Robotics Controls Engineer, Raphe mPhibr
  * Leading AI Research Team for control systems and computer vision at UAV startup for autonomy 
  * Trajectory Generation & Control: Engineered novel path-planning techniques and trajectory generation algorithms for autonomous UAVs, implementing PID and nonlinear control strategies to ensure stability and robust trajectory tracking under sensor noise, all using C++, LUA, and Python
  * Perception-Action Loops: Managing the development of end-to-end navigation pipelines, integrating visual odometry, SLAM, and 3D point-cloud processing (LiDAR) for real-time obstacle avoidance and path planning.
  * Real-Time Inference Optimization: Deployed AI models to edge devices (Jetson, AGX Orin) by optimizing CUDA code with TensorRT, significantly enhancing system performance for real-time applications.
  * Perception and Planning: Designed and tested UAV navigation pipelines by integrating visual odometry, SLAM, and path-planning for obstacle avoidance in real-time to enable autonomous obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. 
* Researcher, Medical Robotics and Automation Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Published 7 first-author research articles and conference proceedings in top-tier publication venues such as IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, Nature Portfolio Scientific Reports, IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics, ICRA, IROS, and ISMR.
  * Developed and optimized advanced computer vision (OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) and machine learning algorithms for image-based target tracking (RGB, C-arm Fluoroscopy, Ultrasound) and guidance in fast moving robotic autonomous systems, achieving sub-2mm tracking accuracy in dynamic environments. Extensive  hands-on image signal processing experience, with work in 2D/3D Reconstruction for medical images through camera calibration and imaging system modeling.
  * Collaborated with ultrasound fabrication specialists to develop image beamforming algorithms to improve signal-to noise ratio for image formation form PZT crystals, utilizing optics, PSF (Point Spread Function) convolution, modeling sensor noise, and Fourier theory and Nyquist sampling criteria for mitigating aliasing. 
  * Tailored state-of-the-art pre-trained object detection models (YOLO/ OWL), and semantic segmentation architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, Vision Transformers) and trained custom models with hyperparameter tuning, all with custom labeled datasets with synthetic data generation for dataset augmentation.
  * Collaborated closely with embedded software engineers to write efficient, C/C++ code for programs running on ARM Cortex and STM32 microcontrollers/communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI, Ethernet).
  * Developed and implemented advanced planning, data-driven ML perception models (3D Computer Vision), and feedback control algorithms, integrating sensor fusion, state estimation, and real-time actuation of steerable continuum robots for reliable performance in dynamic environments.
* Founding VR/AR Ultrasound Engineer, Stealth Startup
  * Worked as the first engineer at a startup at Georgia Tech to visualize 3D ultrasound images in VR and AR machines to extend capabilities of physicians to localize organs and other points-of-interest during diagnostic and interventional procedures.
  * Optimized rendering algorithms for low-latency AR guidance (under 50ms), extending ultrasound capabilities to interventional workflows and reducing manual probe adjustments.
  * Collaborated with physicians to iterate prototypes, validating system through 20+ mock procedures that demonstrated 30% faster localization times
