The talk introduces the design of a guidewire capable of achieving rotation motion at the distal end by utilizing a mechanism, which converts linear motion into rotation motion. The proposed robot consists of two tubes: the inner tube with a notched section capable of bending, and an outer tube with a helical guide. The two tubes are coupled together such that the linear motion of the outer tube facilitates the rotation motion of the inner tube.
