* **Course Instruction:** Assisted in the instruction of graduate-level robotics courses, focusing on control theory, autonomous systems, and robotic manipulation.
* **Lab Leadership:** Supervised hands-on laboratory sessions where students programmed and deployed algorithms on physical robotic platforms (e.g., TurtleBots, Franka Emika).
* **Technical Mentorship:** Provided one-on-one technical guidance during office hours, helping students debug complex Python/C++ code and implement Kalman filters and PID controllers.
* **Grading & Assessment:** Evaluated technical reports and final project codebases, ensuring students met the rigorous standards of the Georgia Tech Robotics Ph.D. program.
* **Collaboration:** Worked closely with faculty to refine course materials and integrate modern industry tools like ROS2 and NVIDIA Isaac Sim into the curriculum.
